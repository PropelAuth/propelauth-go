todo:

- allow depedency injection with interfaces on the helpers, so the client has a QueryHelperInterface, which by default adds the QueryHelper, but a test could instead put in a TestQueryHelper that implements the QueryHelperInterface
- rearrange the files into "models" "helpers" "jwt"
- organize endpoint methods into "endpoints" dir?
- test .github workflow
- instal and run lint and fix recomendations
